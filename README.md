Homicides related to gangs are prevalent around the world especially in countries of Latin America. Current research has largely ignored the gang related homicides that accounts for :1- untapped dependencies between gangs and spatial areas,2-area specific crime patterns 3- insufficient specially detailed predictive signals. These challenges are addressed by proposed context-aware multi-task multi-level learning framework to jointly learn area-speciﬁc crime prediction models and the potential operating territories of gangs. Web scrapped news articles from Bogota´, Colombia were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Used NLP techniques (LDA, etc.) to learn diﬀerent sets of keywords for two diﬀerent levels of features: crime related common keywords and area-speciﬁc keywords focusing on gangs based on speciﬁc locations.

For classification task, proposed model was compared with SVM, Logistic regression, regularized LASSO, and baseline approach Monotonic multitask.
For the homicidal violence prediction task, four performance metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC -AUC (Area Under the Curve) were considered. On average Proposed model performs better than others (better F1 score).

The results show that proposed model can eﬀectively predict gang-homicides and homicidal-violence intensity.
